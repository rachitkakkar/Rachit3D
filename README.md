# TODO
- Add my cool images to the README
- Finish uploading glm so other people can run [ for now just replaces the `vendor/glm` folder with the full release, github doesn't allow an upload of more than 100 files :( ]
- Figure out how to run (just found the solution file from years ago)
- Blog post?
